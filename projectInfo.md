I want to develop AI Powered Interview Platform for Candidate Evaluation, and I also want to make it startup.

Flow for interviewers (recruiter) -

1. Recruiter will first create account in our platform.
2. Recruiter can setup interview for one candidate or for multiple candidates.
3. Interview consist of MSQ questions, and question answer type of questions (questions like Introduce your self and tell us about your project etc.)
4. When recruiter is creating (setup) the interview, he can add interview question and answer from PDF, or he can also upload resume of candidate and AI will generate Full Interview for that particular candidate, or also fully AI generated Interview option will be there.
5. After the interview was generated then interviewer will get link of that interview, and also key of the interview, so he can share that key with candidate to take their interviews.

Flow for candidates –

1. If candidate have searched that link then if that candidate is not logged in then platform will tell him to login then, he will be able to give that interview.
2. After login he will be moved to interview screen for interview now he can give interview

Interview Features –

1. while candidate is giving interview browsers full screen mode should be enable, and multiple monitors are not allowed.
2. And in interview process there will be one model will run at the background by which if it detect multiple faces, and phone in the camera it will warn candidate or end interview process immediately, and report candidate.
   3.During Interview process candidate will not be able to get out of browser, and into new tab, or switch applications.

What is my goal -
Hiring process in company is consist of multiple steps (rounds) like -

1. Aptitude test.
2. Coadding test, or question paper solving.
3. HR Interview
4. Final Interview.
   So, my goal is that companies should use my platform for 1st or 2nd round not for final round.
